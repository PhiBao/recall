 * The demo story — one source of truth.

 * capture pipeline (Bedrock extraction → Jev judgments → encrypted Walrus
 * blob), so loading the demo produces genuine mainnet blobs rather than
 * fixture rows.
 *
 * The stories are deliberately written the way people actually type (mixed
 * case, informal asides) because that is what broke the old name parser.
