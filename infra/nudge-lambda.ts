/**
 * AWS Lambda handler for Recall's daily nudge cron.
 *
 * Runs the same stale-relationship reconnect logic as `scripts/run-nudges.ts`,
 * but serverless: triggered by an EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) schedule rule
 * (e.g. rate(1 day)). This is the "agents that act" piece — the agent
 * proactively creates follow-ups without being asked.
 *
 * Deploy:
 *   1. Bundle this handler with the repo's lib/ (it needs the projection
 *      store; point RECALL_DATA_PATH at shared storage, e.g. EFS, or accept
 *      that the projection is rebuilt from Walrus via restore).
 *   2. Create a Lambda with handler `nudge-lambda.handler`.
 *   3. Set env: MEMWAL_* (for Walrus writes), NODE_ENV=production.
 *   4. Add an EventBridge rule: `rate(1 day)` → this Lambda.
 *
 * The handler is idempotent: it won't create a second open "reconnect"
 * commitment for a person who already has one.
